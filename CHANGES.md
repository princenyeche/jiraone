from jira import JIRA
from jiraone import LOGIN, endpoint

my_jira = JIRA(server="https://nexusfive.atlassian.net",
                 basic_auth=("prince@example.com",

### Minor #93
* Added a new method `PROJECT.issue_count` which helps to count issues using JQL.
* Added new method `issue_export` which allows you to export all issues within your Jira in a single CSV file.

```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, issue_export
import json

file = "config.json"
config = json.load(open(file))
LOGIN(**config)

jql = "project in (AB, BC, IT, IP) order by created DESC"
issue_export(jql=jql)
```

**Release 0.6.5** - 2022-08-26
### Patch  #86
* * Skipped v0.6.4 as its equivalent to v0.6.5
* Fix for `file_reader` in windows system
* Update to OAuth authentication. Removed `JIRAONE_OAUTH` environment variable and used a property setter instead.
Simply use `LOGIN.save_oauth` and assign a value

### Update
* Added new method to `LOGIN` alias for custom methods
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, endpoint

# previous statement
LOGIN.custom_method("GET", endpoint.myself())
# You can use any HTTP method "PATCH", "OPTIONS"

```
* Added a new method to the `endpoint` alias
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, endpoint

# previous statement
jql = "order by created DESC"
LOGIN.get(endpoint.issue_export(jql))

```
* Now you can use Bearer token with the `LOGIN.token_session()` and you can assign a token to this function.
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, endpoint

# previous statement
url = "https://nexusfive.atlassian.net"
token = "GHxxxxxPPPxx"
# First assign a base_url to the attribute below
LOGIN.base_url = url
# You need to pass the token variable to a keyword argument called `sess`
LOGIN.token_session(sess=token)

```

**Release 0.6.3** - 2022-06-04
### Patch update #85
* Added offline access to OAuth argument
* Bug fix on issue [JIR-8](https://github.com/princenyeche/jiraone/issues/89) affecting windows devices on change_log function
* General patches and doc updates.

**Release 0.6.2** - 2022-04-27
### Patch update #84
* Added a new authentication method using OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
  * With this new method, you can create and add scope to your oauth connection.
  * You will need to either call or set the environment variable `JIRAONE_OAUTH` that stores the OAuth data session.
  * Please note that the `LOGIN.save_oauth` is stored as a string. However, the underlying data is a dictionary which is converted by the oauth method used for authentication.
  * Without doing the below, you will need to re-authenticate every session with your OAuth 2.0 app.

```python
from jiraone import LOGIN
import json

client = {
               "client_id": "JixkXXX",
               "client_secret": "KmnlXXXX",
               "name": "nexusfive",
               "callback_url": "https://auth.atlassian.com/XXXXX",
           }
# saving the oauth session data locally
file = "DATA/cred.json"
dumps = None
if os.path.isfile(file):
    dumps = json.load(open(file))
os.environ["JIRAONE_OAUTH"] = f"{dumps}"
LOGIN(oauth=client)
# LOGIN.save_oauth is a property value, always available
# after an OAuth session is initialized
json.dump(LOGIN.save_oauth,
          open(file, encoding="utf-8", mode="w+"),
          indent=4)
print(LOGIN.get(endpoint.myself()).json())

# saving to a database is similar
# if using `flask` framework and `flask_sqlachemy` we can do the below
# previous import statement
current_user.oauth_token = LOGIN.save_oauth
db.session.commit()
```

* Corrected dot notation method and changed `range` to `enumerate`
* Made documentation update


**Release 0.6.1** - 2022-04-02
### Minor update #83
* Added a correction to #82 with file_writer() to add argument newline when on windows if not on file mode
  * This way, we do not obstruct the binary mode operation.
* Added a new module utils which will now help in writing dictionary object with dot notation.

```python
from jiraone.utils import DotNotation

my_dict = {"name": "Prince"}
dot = DotNotation(my_dict)
print(dot.name)
# result
# Prince
```
* Added a security, code_of_conduct and contribution document files

**Release 0.6.0** - 2022-03-11
### Patch update #80

* Documentation fix


**Release 0.5.9** - 2022-02-24
### Patch update #78
* Patch to `delete_attachments()` and modification of `manage` API docs

* `file_writer` and `file_reader` functions now has the ability to enter a delimiter as a parameter.


**Release 0.5.6** - 2022-02-02
### Patch update #73
* Patch v5 to `time_in_status()`. Noticed that the statuses time were wrong. There seems to be
a change in the way the previous API payload was retrieved. Tweaked the logic for retrieving
accurate difference in time.
* The statuses and their time can now be retrieved accurately.
* The save check_point is turned off for the `time_in_status()` function as a slight logic needs
to be added to account for when a breakpoint happens between checkpoint to retain
accurate difference in time between statuses.

**Release 0.5.5** - 2022-01-30
### Patch update #72
* Patch v4 to `time_in_status()`. Noticed the current status not updated on result file.

**Release 0.4.6** - 2021-10-11
### Micro update #57

* Added two new functions used by organization users such as `bulk_change_email` and `bulk_change_swap_email` in the `jiraone.module`. It makes use of the organization API that was released in #54

For example
```python

manage.add_token(token) # Authenticate to the resource
manage.manage_user(account_id, json=payload) # By default it is set to disable a user
# manage.manage_user(account_id, json=payload, disable=False) # Changing disable=False enables back the user

from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT, file_reader
from jiraone.module import time_in_status
import json

config = json.load(open('config.json'))

## v0.3.7 #42
- Added exceptions class `exceptions.py`
- Created a new module for fields  
- A new function  `field_update` from the module file to handle most field updates.
- v0.3.6 is equivalent to v0.3.7

```python
from jiraone import field, echo, module
#...previous login statements
# first parameter is the field class alias, 2nd param is an issue key, 3rd a Jira field and
# 4th the data value you want to update or change
key = 'T6-73'
field_name = 'A Cascading field'
vals = ['Browser', 'Firefox'] # Cascading field type
echo(module.field_update(field, key, field_name, data=vals))
```


**Release 0.3.5** - 2021-07-12
### #41 Micro update
- Added a new method to get field value in a issue.
```python
from jiraone import field, echo
#...previous login statements
# it expects the field name as the first parameter and the issue key where the field is used as the second parameter
value = field.get_field_value("Labels", "COM-15")
echo(value)
```


**Release 0.3.4** - 2021-05-16
### #38 Micro update
* Added two more attributes to the comment(key).comment() method
* `first_comment` -> returns the first comment in the body content. Can only be called when "body" option is called on the type_field else returns "None".

 * `last_comment` -> returns the last comment in the body content. Can only be called when "body" option is called on the type_field else returns "None".
**Example usage**:

```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, comment

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)

keys = "COM-42"
LOGIN.api = False # this changes the api from 3 to latest.
s = comment(keys).comment("body").first_comment
print(s)
```


**Release 0.3.3** - 2021-04-23
### #37 Micro updates

* Added new methods to the `USER` class and updated the `comment` variable. Now you can be able to post a comment and get a proper comment. The `GET` method has various properties, see the documentation for more details.

* Get a mention of a cloud user.
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    # displayName of a user, to output multiple users separate by a comma
    # name = "Prince Nyeche,Prince,John Doe"
    name = "Prince Nyeche"  
    USER.mention_user(name)
```
* POST a comment to a Jira issue and mention users sequentially on a comment.

```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, USER, comment

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)

key = "COM-42"
name = "Prince Nyeche,Prince"
text = """
        <user> please can you help to check the docker environment? Ping <user> to help out.
        """
comment(key, method="post", text_block=text, placer="<user>", mention=USER.mention_user(name), event=True)
```

The name of users separated by comma, will be changed dynamically within the method. Using the `event=True` argument enables the comment endpoint to switch to post. See more from the `endpoint` methods. As you can see, for any place in the text string where I used
     ***< user >*** that will be replaced to a mentioned format for cloud e.g. [~accountId:5584xxxxxx]



**Release 0.3.1** - 2021-04-10
### #36 Fix bug
* `USER.search_user()` method fails with `TypeError: Expected 4 arguments, got 3` when running a multiuser search via a loop. Somehow the script appends a 3 column header to the csv file. The fix to this problem was to add a kwargs arg to the reader which will skip the header.


**Release 0.3.0** - 2021-03-29
### #34 Minor updates
* Corrected USER.search_user() method if the search file doesn't exist. Rather than throw `FileNotFoundError`, create an empty file.



**Release 0.2.9** - 2021-03-29
### #33 Micro update
* Corrected the return statement for USER.search_user() method so it can return multiple users of the same name if exist.


**Release 0.2.8** - 2021-03-29
### #32 Micro updates
* Added a new reporting method PROJECT.change_log() for fetching issue history.
* updated method PROJECT.download_attachments() method.
* Added method PROJECT.bytes_converter() used for checking KB and MB conversions.
* Added new reporting called USER.search_user() method.

## Find user

```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    name = "Prince Nyeche"  # displayName of a user
    USER.search_user(pull="active", user_type="atlassian", find_user=name)
```

## Changelog

```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
# use {LOGIN.api = False} if you want to extract the issue history from a Server instance
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    jql = "project in (PYT) ORDER BY Rank DESC"  # A valid JQL query
    PROJECT.change_log(jql=jql)
```


**Release 0.2.7** - 2021-03-15
### #31 Micro updates
* Changed the error name on field.extract_issue_field_options() method
* No release for v0.2.6 as it's equivalent to v0.2.7
* Added a comment method which can be called by saying
```python
from jiraone import comment

```

* That variable is still a work in progress, for now you can only get comments. Other abilities should include creating and updating comments



**Release 0.2.5** - 2021-03-04
### #30 Micro updates
* Added attribute `LOGIN.api` - it is a bool attribute and it helps to toggle the api version from "3" to "latest". This is useful, when you want to make a call to a Server or Datacenter instance of Jira.
Example usage:
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN

user = "username"
password = "password"
link = "https://yourinstance.server.com"
LOGIN.api = False # this sets the api to latest
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)
```


**Release 0.2.4** - 2021-02-21
### #27 Micro update
* Corrected some methods of the `Field class`



**Release 0.2.3** - 2021-02-14
### #23 Micro update

* Added a new class `Field` with an alias `field` used to link to the class. It comes with various methods for updating system or custom fields.
* No release for v0.2.2 as it is equal to v0.2.3

Example usage: <br />
```python
from jiraone import field, echo, LOGIN

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)

issue = "T6-75"
fields = "Multiple files" # a multiselect custom field
case_value = ["COM Row 1", "Thanos"]
# add multiple values to a multiselect custom field
for value in case_value:
    c = field.update_field_data(data=value, find_field=fields, key_or_id=issue, options="add", show=False)
    echo(c)

# output
# < Response[204] >
```


**Release 0.2.1** - 2021-02-09

from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT


user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    # this method uses various keyword arguments:
    # pull -> string - available options [active, inactive, both]
    # user_type -> string - available options [atlassian, customer, app, unknown]
    # find_user -> string - display name of the user you're searching for
    # duration -> string - jql function to denote days of calendar e.g. startOfWeek(-1) or startOfMonth(-1)
    # status -> string - statuses you want to check e.g Open or Closed or Open, Closed for multiple statuses check
    # file -> string - a file name to use as place_holder for user search. if not it defaults to user_file.csv
